Hey, Hey!  
You're Back...

...

Whooaaa! You earned a ton of power-ups!
Amazing Job.

We can improve your car a bunch with this. 

How, you ask?
You just leave that to me!

All you got let me know which attributes you want to use your power-ups 
on to improve. There's several areas we can work on to make your car 
better for the Math Race.

Huh, what attributes are there you ask??
...well... uhh, lets see... 

First off, there's of course "speed".  This allows you to go faster.
I doubt I need to explain why speed is important in a race, but, just so
you're aware--if you can't go faster than your fastest opponent, you
probably won't win!  You're "speedometer" tells you how fast your going.

"acceleration" which will help you get up to your maximum speed quicker.
This is especially handy if you bump into alot of stuff, because that will
slow you down.  You can accelerate your car with the <space> key. 
When you want to give it gas, keep that baby held down!

"handling" will make your car steer better.  
Better handling is super important when your racing the twisties.
Without good handling, your bound to go off-track! You can turn your car 
with the <left> and <right> arrow keys.

Your vehicle "health" is also important.  You will always start a race with 
100% health, but, if you increase this attribute, your car doesn't get
banged up easily when you, erm, "bump" into things.  

And, be careful! If your health gets too low your car won't drive as good...
If it gets all the way to 0, well...I also manage a thriving tow buisiness!

Last, there's the "boost" attribute (my favorite hehe).  This will cost you
more power-up points to improve than the other attributes.  But, if
you've  earned enough, I can give your car shots of NOS to go suuuuper 
fast. Remember, you can use the <n> key to get the NOS a-flowin'during
the race and hang-on tight!

So lets get to upgrading your car... Just select the attribute you want to
improve from the menu with the <up> and <down> arrow keys, and then,
select how many points to use with the <right> and <left> arrow keys.  
When you're happy, press <enter> to confirm and let 'ol Speedy work his
magic!  

I know you're itchin' to get out there, so once we're done with these
upgrades, we'll get this baby over to the track!! And, you can do your
thing.

Oh...I almost forgot. I know we covered all the basics around racing,
but, I'll give you one final pro tip:

For tighter turns, release the accelerator (<space> key), and hold down
your car's e-brake (<b> key) while turning with the (<left> or <right> keys).
This way, you'll drift like a champion, even if your car's handling
attribute is not so stellar.

Ok, enough, talk.  This is where the rubber meets the road.  Let's take
your car to the next level and get on out there.  
You just point-and-shoot, and I'll do the rest.

And, Happy Racing!
