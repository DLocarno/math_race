Hey there!  
My name's Speedy.

Hey, were you planning on entering the Math Race!?

Hmmmm...you got a nice looking ride there, but, it looks like there's 
definitely room for improvement...
If you had some power-ups, I could help you make it much better.

How do you earn power-ups?

Well, by working on some math problems of course!
The more problems you can solve, the more power-ups you will earn.
Then, we can use them to take your car to the next-level. 

Remember-- more correct answers in a row will give you a 
multiplier bonus and you can earn even more power-ups for 
your car this way!

But, be careful! Wrong answers will reset your multiplier bonus.  
So just be sure to take your time on the problems if you need to!

Solve as many problems as you can and I promise I will 
help you power up your car to beat-out the competition!

So keep building up those math skills, you will end up taking home 
the gold for sure! Remember--practice makes perfect.

Goodluck!
